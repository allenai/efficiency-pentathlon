# DEEP-mon

Dynamic and Energy Efficient Power monitor (DEEP-mon) is an eBPF based monitoring tool to measure power consumption and performance of Docker containers. DEEP-mon started in 2017 as a research project of [NECSTLab](https://necst.it) at Politecnico di Milano with the goal of being able to measure the power consumption of each container running in a given host. The project then expanded and now DEEP-mon is able to measure power consumption, performance counters, CPU usage, Memory usage, Network I/O, and File I/O, all displayed in a curses UI terminal window.

## Getting started

### Requirements

DEEP-mon currently runs on Docker and it is almost self contained. Requirements are:

- Linux kernel >= 4.13
- kernel headers
- make
- docker
- intel_rapl module (for power consumption on Intel&reg; processors)

We tested DEEP-mon on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. The power attribution feature of DEEP-mon targets the SMT capability of Intel&reg; Sandy bridge and Ivy bridge server class processors. For other architectures a new attribution factor should be tested and used (more details [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8425477) and [here](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions/presentation/zhai)).

### Build and Run

To build the container, within the root folder of the project type:

```bash
make build
```

To run the container, within the root folder of the project type:

```bash
make run
```

## Contributing

Contribution is welcome!

* Create a pull request containing bug fixes or new features.
* [Propose](https://github.com/necst/DEEP-mon/issues/new) new functions and improvements

## DEEP-mon roadmap:
* fix performance issue with memory metrics
* experimental measurement tool -> record stuff, single machine + distributed
* frequency sampling
* improve parameter injection
* set attribution ratio in config
* improve curse UI
* documentation (code + md files)
* tests
* add k8s pod name, deployments, services (e.g. readable k8s data)
* one UI per cluster (daemonset), server w/data, cli
* web UI
